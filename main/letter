	So, here is the master disk and the original marker at last,hopefully before November 1! The contract is also enclosed. Withmy fathers signature (What a pity! I'm only 17!).
	I was wondering if you have any distributor in Norway,'cause if you don't then I'd like to check out the market in thecomputer shops, and if it seems good, then I could make some moremoney by selling the game in Norway at 65% of the income, and asales price to the shops at kr. 98,© and a cutomar price at kr.149,© (about DM 38,30) The rest would be for you...
	I hope this works on all amiga systems! If not, include abootblock that turns off the drives and memory for me!
